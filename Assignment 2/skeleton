     (Note that a new line can be a single "\n" or a character pair "\r\n".)
     Examine the first line (request line);
     If the request method is not "GET" {

     Make TCP connection to the "real" Web server;
     Send over an HTTP request;

     Close the TCP connection to the server;
     Send the server's response back to the client;
     Close the connection socket to the client.
